   sudo apt install ansible -y
   /etc/ansible/hosts

   172.31.29.52
   172.31.24.52
   ansible -m ping all     ### for check connection between master Test & prod.
   create two script file (one for master and one for slave)
   sudo nano master.sh     ### mater.sh file is attached in repo
   sudo nano slave.sh      ### slave.sh file is attached in repo
   sudo nano play.yml      ### play.yml file is attached in folder 
   ansible-playbook play.yml --check  #### check for dry run
   ansible-playbook play.yml

5- Open any borwser and paste jenkin server ip
   https://3.145.189.184:8080    ### configure the jenkins
   
   Add new node-name slave1-l,remote root directory-/home/ubuntu/jenkins,launch method-Agent via ssh,host-private ip of test node,
   credential-add-jenkins-kind-ssh username with private key user name-ubuntu private key enter directory put the pem key contain
   credential-ubuntu,host key verification strategy-non verifiying  strategy - save


   Add new node-name slave2,copy existing slave1-select-slave1-change private ip of prod node-save

6- Go to github account fork of this repo
   https://github.com/hshar/website
   create dockerfile  ### dockerfile is attached in repo
   Create a new branch name devlop
   Create a webhook http://35.175.237.66:8080/github-webook/
   
7- Create a job in jenkins server
   job1 -> test node -> develop branch  ### Build the job
   job2 -> test node -> main branch     ### Test the job
   job3 -> prod node -> main branch     ### Run with the production environment


   Create job -> name-job1->free style project ->restrict where this project can be run-label expression-salve1 ->Git paste the repo url ->
   Branch develop ->select github hook triggerd for gitscm -> save
   After that go to test node /jenkins/workspace/job1    ### i can see dockerfile,index and images file is there 
   we need to run automate conatiner.Then go to job1->Build steps-execute shell-

   sudo docker build /home/ubuntu//jenkins/workspace/Job1/ -t job1
   sudo docker run -itd -p 83:80 --name=c1 job1


   After that open browser and paste the public ip of Test node 
   http://54.166.226.217:83/       ### web page  is working now 

8- Go to Github repo in devlop branch and some line add in  index.html file.
   After commit jenkins automatically triggred the job 

   Go to Job1 ->configure -> execute shell add one line for delete the old  container name c1 if it not delete job will not run
   sudo docker rm -f c1
   sudo docker build /home/ubuntu//jenkins/workspace/Job1/ -t job1
   sudo docker run -itd -p 83:80 --name=c1 job1

9- Create job2->name-job2 ->free style project ->restrict where this project can be run-label expression-salve1 ->Git paste the repo url ->
   Branch main ->select github hook triggerd for gitscm ->Build step
   sudo docker build /home/ubuntu//jenkins/workspace/Job2/ -t job2
   sudo docker run -itd -p 82:80 --name=c2 job2      #### Save

   
   After that open browser and paste the public ip of Test node 
   http://54.166.226.217:82/       ### web page  is working now with new changes

10- Go to Github repo in main branch and some line add in  index.html file.
   After commit jenkins automatically triggred the job 
   Go to Job2 ->configure -> execute shell add one line for delete the old  container name c2 if it not delete job will not run
   sudo docker rm -f c2
   sudo docker build /home/ubuntu//jenkins/workspace/Job2/ -t job2
   sudo docker run -itd -p 82:80 --name=c2 job2      #### Save

   After that open browser and paste the public ip of Test node 
   http://54.166.226.217:82/       ### web page  is working now with new changes 

11-Create job -> name-job3->free style project ->restrict where this project can be run-label expression-salve2 ->Git paste the repo url ->
   Branch main ->select github hook triggerd for gitscm ->Build steps ->execute shell
   sudo docker build /home/ubuntu//jenkins/workspace/Job3/ -t job3
   sudo docker run -itd -p 85:80 --name=c3 job3      #### Save

   
   After that open browser and paste the public ip of Prod node 
   http://89.106.24.27:85       ### web page  is working now 
12- Go to Github repo in main branch and some line add in  index.html file.
   After commit jenkins automatically triggred the job 
   Go to Job3 ->configure -> execute shell add one line for delete the old  container name c3 if it not delete job will not run
   sudo docker rm -f c3
   sudo docker build /home/ubuntu//jenkins/workspace/Job3/ -t job3
   sudo docker run -itd -p 85:80 --name=c2 job3    #### Save


   After that open browser and paste the public ip of Test node 
   http://89.106.24.27:85       ### web page  is working now with new changes
